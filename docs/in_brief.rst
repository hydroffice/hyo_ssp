In brief

The SSP hydro-package has been developing with the aim to merge together functionalities present in several
applications that process sound speed profiles (SSP) for underwater acoustic systems.

The initial core functionalities come from SVP Editor, an application originally developed at the `Center for
Coastal and Ocean Mapping (CCOM, UNH) <http://ccom.unh.edu/>`_ by Jonathan Beaudoin (`Multibeam Advisory Committee
<http://mac.unols.org/>`_)
under the NSF grant 1150574, to provide pre-processing tools to help bridge the gap between
sound speed profiling instrumentation and multibeam echosounder acquisition systems.

In the conversion from this original implementation to the current hydro-package several improvements have been
introduced to enhance code maintainability, to make it available in the Pydro environment, as well as to also
to support Python 3 (from the original Python 2 only implementation) and to store the collected data for further
processing and analysis.
